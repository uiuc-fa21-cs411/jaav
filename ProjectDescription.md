# Project Title: Trailture

## Description
- A nature application that allows users to find and visit parks/trails/campsites/outdoor recreational activities near their location. Users can also view biodiversity at the specific site that they choose to visit (includes plants, wildlife, etc.)
- We want users to be able to search and filter based on their preferences to visit outdoor sites of their choice.

## Usefulness
- Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.  Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there?  If so, what are they and how is yours different?
- Users often are looking for outdoor activities in locations that they are visiting. Our application will be able to provide this to users while also allowing them to experience the natural wildlife around them.

## Realness
- Describe what your data is and where you will get it.

## Description of Functionality 
- Description of the functionality that your website offers. This is where you talk about what the website delivers. Talk about how a user would interact with the application (i.e. things that one could create, delete, update, or search for) Read the requirements for stages 4 and 5 to see what other functionalities you want to provide to the users. 

## UI Mockup
- What do you imagine your final applicationâ€™s interface might look like? A PowerPoint slide or a pencil sketch on a piece of paper works!

## Work Distribution
- Who would be responsible for each of the tasks or subtasks?
